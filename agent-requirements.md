Agent Requirements: AI-Powered Java & Spring Boot Upgrader
This document outlines the functional and environmental requirements for building a standalone autonomous agent to upgrade Java and Spring Boot projects, with a core architecture based on LangChain and LangGraph.

Core Objective
The agent's primary mission is to automate the process of upgrading Java and Spring Boot projects by analyzing their codebase, applying relevant OpenRewrite recipes, dynamically generating fixes for custom code, and submitting the changes for human review via a pull request.

1. Agent Architecture & Components
The agent's logic will be implemented as a stateful graph using LangGraph, executed by a main Python script.

Host Execution Environment: The agent is designed to run in any environment that can execute a Python script, such as a developer's local machine, a CI/CD runner, or a generic container. It is self-contained and not dependent on a specific platform.

Agent Core (LangGraph): The agent's brain and workflow will be defined as a cyclical graph using LangGraph. This manages the agent's state and orchestrates the flow between different tools and decision points.

Tools & LLM Integration (LangChain): The individual capabilities of the agent will be built using LangChain. This includes:

LLM Chains: For interacting with GPT (default) or other configurable Large Language Models to analyze files, generate plans, and create custom OpenRewrite recipes from compiler errors.

Custom Tools: Python functions that the LangGraph agent can call. These tools will wrap command-line utilities like git, mvn/gradle, and the OpenRewrite CLI.

Execution Environment: The agent is designed to run in any Python environment with the following requirements:

Python: With langchain, langgraph, and all necessary libraries.

A recent Java Development Kit (JDK), such as JDK 21.

Build Tools: Maven and/or Gradle (must be pre-installed).

Version Control: Git command-line client.

OpenRewrite CLI: The command-line tool for applying recipes (automatically installed by the agent).

Version Control System (VCS) Integration: The agent will interact with GitHub repositories via command-line tools and GitHub APIs, using credentials provided securely to its environment.

2. Script Arguments & Outputs
The agent will be controlled via command-line arguments passed to its main execution script.

Required Arguments:

--repository-url <url>: The SSH or HTTPS URL of the Git repository.

--base-branch <branch>: The starting branch to work from (e.g., main).

Optional Arguments:

--target-version <version>: The desired Java or Spring Boot version.

--llm-model <model>: The LLM model to use (default: gpt-4).

--max-attempts <number>: Maximum troubleshooting attempts (default: 5).

--new-branch-name <name>: The name for the new feature branch.

Primary Output (to standard output):

A JSON object containing the pull_request_url and a summary_report of the agent's actions.

3. Workflow Logic & LangGraph Structure
The agent's execution flow must be implemented as a graph in LangGraph.

üöÄ Setup Node:

Parses command-line arguments.

Installs OpenRewrite CLI if not present.

Calls a git tool to clone the repository and create a new branch.

üß† Analysis Node:

Auto-detects build tool (Maven or Gradle) by scanning for pom.xml or build.gradle files.

Reads the project's build file and identifies current Java/Spring Boot versions.

Calls an LLM chain to devise an upgrade strategy for both Java and Spring Boot versions.

Adds the initial list of standard OpenRewrite recipes to the agent's state.

üõ†Ô∏è Apply Recipes Node:

Retrieves the current list of recipes from the state.

Calls a tool that executes the OpenRewrite CLI to apply them.

‚öôÔ∏è Verification Node:

Calls a tool to run the project's build and test command (e.g., mvn clean verify).

Updates the state with the build result (success or failure) and captures any errors.

Conditional Edge (Router):

After the Verification Node, a conditional edge checks the build status from the state.

If successful: Transition to the Finalization Node.

If it fails: Transition to the Troubleshooting Node.

ü©∫ Troubleshooting Node:

Takes the compiler errors from the state.

Calls an LLM chain to generate a custom OpenRewrite recipe to fix the specific error.

Adds the new, temporary recipe to the list of recipes in the state.

Transitions back to the Apply Recipes Node to create a loop. A circuit breaker (configurable max attempts, default 5) must be implemented in the state to prevent infinite cycles.

‚úÖ Finalization Node:

Calls git tools to commit all changes and push the branch.

Calls GitHub API (using PyGithub) to create a pull request.

Prints the final JSON output to standard output.

4. Security & Safety Requirements
Secrets Management: All credentials (LLM API key, Git token) must be provided to the agent through secure means, such as environment variables or a secrets management tool. They must never be hardcoded.

Human-in-the-Loop: The agent must not have permission to merge its own pull requests. The final step is always a PR for human review.
